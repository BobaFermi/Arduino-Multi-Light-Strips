# Light-Strip-Controller

Arduino Mega code to control multiple WS2812b RGB LED strips using buttons, LCD screen and motion sensor.

The buttons allow to select the colour mode and brightness of the LEDs and switch them on and off. The LCD displays the mode, brightness and state of the lights. The colours are as follows - White, Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Rainbow (all colours move across the LED strips in a smooth transition), and Xmas (alternate lights flashing red and green).
